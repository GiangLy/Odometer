Program Number: 2

Description of Problem:
Define a class called Odometer that will contain member variables to 
define the number of miles driven, the number of gallons, and the fuel 
efficiency (miles per gallon).  The class should have a default
constructor that will initialize all the variables to zero.  
It should also have a constructor that will take the number of miles
driven and the number of gallons as parameters.  This constructor will 
calculate the miles per gallon.  There will be a function that can add 
a trip and a function to check mileage.  Include a function that will 
print out the information from the function.  Write a main program that 
will test the class.  You should create at least three trips and make 
sure all of the member functions are executed and work properly.
